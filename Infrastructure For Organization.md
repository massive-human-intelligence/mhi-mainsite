# Infrastructure For Organization

A starting list of the essentials for an organization coming into existence, with a particular focus on the infrastructure that helps more people connect with us.

- A “good” name, that helps people find us.
- A place to talk amongst ourselves, a chat channel or email list.
- A document library (a wiki, or Notion, or Google Docs…)
- “Web presence” - a home page or a web site, so you can give people a link to read more and get in touch. it’s best if it’s on a domain we own.
- A short summary of our vision and mission, how we want the world to be better.
- Who we are. At least our leadership, and some organizational contact information.
- What help we need, what roles we need to fill, how to contact us about that.
- Our financial resources now, and what we need to continue. Fundraising we’ve started - how to donate, what we’re trying to fund.
- Appropriate social and legal structure.
